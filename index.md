## Abstract
Europe, 2019.  
It appears that right-wing populists are on the rise in many countries. But can you really compare these parties between countries? What do they have in common? How do they differ?
What is the general political orientation on controversial themes in different countries and what is the position of the leading politicians on these themes?
Is the 'Alternative for Germany' similar to 'Lega Nord'?
in this project we will take a short journey through the different political topics. For this purpose, we will focus on the larger EU member states France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Poland.  

The main goal is to examine how much the political scenario in one topic changes from one of these countries to another. Taking into account the quotes and the party of politicians, we will discover the hottest topics in each country and compare them to the ones of other countries.

Besides, we will investigate how politicians from different countries position themselves over the same topics, especially if they come from the same political background (i.e. right parties, left parties), by analyzing the similarities and the differences.

## More precise: our research questions
1. How much does the political scenario in some hot topics (migration, climate change, EU, gender discrimination, drug legalization, russian politician) change from one country to another? Why is that?
2. Considering rigth-hand parties (AfD(Germany), Lega Nord(Italy), Front National(France), PiS(Poland)), how much do their opinions differ compared to a party with similar political orientation from another country?
3. How do the important politicans of these parties positioning themselves over topics (migration, climate change, EU, gender discrimination, drug legalization, russian politician)?


## Methods  

## Topic selection
We decided to examine the situation of each country in the following topics: 
- Immigration
- European Union and Brexit
- Discriminations (racism, based on gender, homophobia)
- Israeli-Palestinian conflict
- Russia and Putin
- COVID-19
- Terrorism

### Immigration
Let's start our journey by taking a look into one of the most controvers discussed topic in the European countries, the immigration theme. How did it develop over time?

![Topic Distribution over all countries](/assets/img/Project_graphics/Immigration_Distribution_over_time_allcountries.png)

First, you may have noticed that on average there are fewer citations in the colder months. The reason for this is that migrants prefer to take advantage of better weather and therefore their number rises in warmer months.
Second, you can see 2 clear peaks. It seems that immigration made headlines in September 2015 and June 2018. What happened in these months? To get an answer to this question, let's look at the distribution w.r.t each country. 
The peaks distinguish quite a lot in each country:

![Topic Distribution over all countries](/assets/img/Project_graphics/Immigration_Distribution_over_time_percountry.png)


##### <center>September 2015</center>  

Let's start with the situation in **2015**. Do you remember the refugee routes?  
In 2015, the main route shifted from the dangerous Mediterranean, crossing from Libya to Italy, to another one crossing from Turkey to Greek islands like Lesvos, what would prove to be even deadlier.
This explains why the peak is completely absent in Italy's point of view and, in the other hand, is quite marked in Germany or Poland.
Over 75% of those arriving in Europe had fled conflict and persecution in Syria, Afghanistan or Iraq.

The peak on this month can be sadly explained by a drammatic event that took place on 2 September 2015.
On this day, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Alan_Kurdi'>Alan Kurdi</a>, a three-years-old Syrian boy, lost his life trying to reach Europe from Turkey.
The photo of his body laying on a beach in Turkey moved millions worldwide.

By the time Aylan's body washed ashore, more than 300,000 people had risked their lives to reach Europe. Over 2,600 had perished in the attempt.

##### <center>June 2018 and Matteo Salvini</center>  

<center><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0260/production/_102080600_migrant_ship_with_spain_640_v4-nc.png" width=600></center>  

At first glance, the peak in **June 2018** is clearly caused by Italy and, most likely, by the most popular speaker in the immigration topic, Matteo Salvini. However, this huge crest could be quite weird by just looking at <a href='https://www.youtrend.it/2021/02/15/sbarchi-e-immigrazione-in-italia-il-punto-della-situazione/'>data.</a> The number of migrants in 2018 is quite low if compared to the figures of the previous years.

However, something happened in Italian politics during these days. Indeed, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteo_Salvini'>Matteo Salvini</a>, leader of the far-right party "Lega Nord", was sworn in as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior on 1 June 2018. He immediately stated that his main aim was to drastically reduce the number of illegal immigrants to Italy.  

On 10 June 2018, **Salvini**, who is also the person with the most quotes in immigration (see plot below), announced the closure of Italian ports. The vessel <b>Aquarius</b>, which carried more than 600 migrants, was refused a port of disembarkation by the Italian authorities. It was accepted by Spanish authorities, and it finally arrived at the Port of Valencia on 17 June 2018.

### European Union and Brexit  
This time we will start our analysis from the most popular speakers:  
![Brexit Top Speakers](/assets/img/Project_graphics/Brexit_Top_Speakers.png)  

We can see, indeed, that there are eminent European politicians:
- Donald Tusk (President of the European Council from 2014 to 2019)
- Michel Barnier (Former European Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms)
- Pierre Moscovici (Former European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs).
- Ursula von der Leyen (President of the European Commission)  

How was the distribution of the number of quotes per country?:  

![Brexit Distribution per country](/assets/img/Project_graphics/Brexit_Distribution_per_country.png) 

As we will see, the peaks correspond to important events of Brexit, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.

#### <center>March 2017</center>
<center><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Prime_Minister%E2%80%99s_letter_to_Donald_Tusk_triggering_Article_50.pdf/page1-390px-Prime_Minister%E2%80%99s_letter_to_Donald_Tusk_triggering_Article_50.pdf.jpg' width=300></center>

On 29 March 2017, the United Kingdom invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union which began the member state's withdrawal from the European Union.

In compliance with the TEU, the UK gave formal notice to the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the EU to allow withdrawal negotiations to begin.

#### <center>March 2019</center>

The UK had long been expected to leave the European Union at 11pm on 29 March 2019.  However, following a House of Commons vote on 14 March 2019, the Government sought permission from the EU to extend Article 50 and agree a later Brexit date.

On 20 March 2019 the Prime Minister, Theresa May, wrote to European Council President Donald Tusk, asking to extend Article 50 until 30 June 2019.

#### <center>October 2019</center>
In the run-up to the scheduled date for the UK’s departure at Halloween, Boris Johnson’s government finally sealed a new exit deal with the EU – but a missed deadline in the British parliament forced the prime minister by law to seek another Brexit delay.

European leaders agreed to the request for a three-month extension, while UK lawmakers finally agreed to an early general election in December to try to clear the path ahead.

### Discrimination
![Discrimination Distribution per country](/assets/img/Project_graphics/Discrimination_Distribution_percountry.png)  

First, we can observe a huge peak in France January 2015.
In addition, there are a few more peaks, more accentuated in the countries distributions.

#### <center>January 2015</center>
The most important peak is linked to the Islamic terrorism attacks of the same month in France.

It is also an important event for discriminations. The former President of France, Hollande, affirmed that radical Islam had fed off contradictions, poverty, inequality and conflict, and that "it is Muslims who are the first victims of fanaticism, fundamentalism and intolerance".

He also added that "French Muslims have the same rights as all other French [...]. We have the obligation to protect them. [...] Anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic acts have to be condemned and punished."

#### <center>July 2016</center>
As in the last case, the peak is mainly because of Donald Tusk's statements on Nice terrorism attack. In fact, he affirmed that the "subjects of the attack were people celebrating liberty, equality and fraternity".

#### <center>March 2017</center>
This peak can be linked to the third top speaker: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bach'>Thomas Bach</a>, President of the International Olympic Committee.
In fact, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Executive Board on this day approved a major review project regarding gender equality in the Olympic Movement.

#### <center>October 2017</center>
This time the main term is "liberty". In fact, in October 2017, the <b>Catalan independence referendum</b> took place.

#### <center>February 2018</center>
On 3 February 2018, in the city of Macerata, Marche, 28-year-old local Luca Traini seriously wounded, in a drive-by shooting, six African migrants.
After the attack, <b>Traini</b> reportedly had an Italian flag draped on his shoulders and raised his arm in a Fascist salute.

Traini said the attack was revenge for the murder of Pamela Mastropietro, an 18-year-old local girl whose dismembered body had been found a few days earlier, stuffed into two suitcases and dumped in the countryside. For this, a 29-year-old Nigerian national and failed asylum seeker, Innocent Oseghale, had been arrested and charged.

#### <center>April 2018</center>
On 17 April 2018, <b>Adam Armoush</b>, a 21-year-old Israeli Arab living in Berlin and his German friend of Moroccan origin went through a street in Prenzlauer Berg taking selfies while wearing kippahs.

At one point, an argument with three Arab-speaking young men started, which was followed by a violent attack. Armoush managed to document the violence with his cell phone and later allowed the video to be shared on Facebook, from where the video went viral.

The video shows the main attacker beat Armoush repeatedly with his belt. During the onslaught, the attacker shouted the word "Yahudi", the Arabic word for Jew, before one his companions intervened and dragged him away.

### Israeli - Palestinian conflict
![Israeli Distribution per country](/assets/img/Project_graphics/Israeli_Distribution_percountry.png)    

First, we can observe that this topic was mainly discussed in the month of December 2017.

#### <center>December 2017</center>
<center><img src='https://live.staticflickr.com/4268/33997342614_331b473fc4_b.jpg' width=600></center>

This peak was caused by something that, actually, happened in the USA: President Donald Trump has announced that the US recognises Jerusalem as Israel's capital, overturning decades of official US policy.

The fate of the ancient city is one of the thorniest issues between Israel and the Palestinians.
Israel called Mr Trump's move "historic" but there has been sharp international criticism.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called Mr Trump's announcement "deplorable", saying the US could no longer be a peace broker.

The decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital puts the US at odds with the rest of the international community's view on Jerusalem's status.

#### February 2018

This time, the peak is more about one of the two countries: Israel.
On 6 February 2018, the President of Poland signed an amendment to the Law on the Institute of National Remembrance, which makes it a crime to publicly claim that Poland had any responsibility for or complicity in the Holocaust.

The law met with widespread international criticism, as it was seen as an infringement on freedom of expression and on academic freedom, and as a barrier to open discussion on Polish collaborationism, in what has been described as "the biggest diplomatic crisis in Poland's recent history".

#### February 2020

On 23 February 2020, European foreign policy chief, the Spanish Josep Borrell, has criticized Israel’s announced plans to build a new neighborhood in East Jerusalem and expand another, warning such action “would be deeply detrimental to a two-state-solution.”

He said the European Union would not recognize any changes to Israel’s pre-1967 borders and urged Jerusalem to reconsider its plan.  
He also appears in our top speakers ranking for this topic:

### Climate change
![Climate Change Distribution per country](/assets/img/Project_graphics/ClimateChange_Distribution_percountry.png)     

We can see that this time the distribution in all the countries look alike.

There are a few important peaks.
The peak in France in December 2016.
There are peaks for all countries in June 2017.
The last one is in Germany in December 2019.

#### <center>December 2015</center>
<center><img src='https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/assets/2016/04/24195/image1170x530cropped.jpg'  width=600></center>

To tackle climate change and its negative impacts, world leaders at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris reached a breakthrough on 12 December 2015: the historic <b>Paris Agreement</b>.
This also explains the reason why this peak is particularly pronounced in France.

The central objective of the Paris Agreement is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.

To achieve this long-term temperature goal, countries aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century.

#### June 2017

On June 1, 2017, United States President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would cease all participation in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change mitigation, contending that the agreement would "undermine" the U.S. economy, and put the U.S. "at a permanent disadvantage."

#### <center>December 2019</center>
<center><img src='https://www.aivp.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/European-Green-Deal.png' width=600></center>

The Commission's President Ursula von der Leyen presented on 11 December 2019 the <b>European Green Deal</b>, a plan to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.

The Green Deal is a new growth strategy to make the EU's economy sustainable and create sustainable industry and transport.

The fact that the main actor of this event was Ursula von der Leyen, explains why the peak is more acute in the German distribution.

### Russia
![Rusia Distribution per country](/assets/img/Project_graphics/Rusia_Distribution_percountry.png)  
We can see that France, Italy and Germany, due to their similar positions.
On the other hand, the topic was almost not touched by Spain and Poland, except for two months.

The main peak was reached on February 2015. During this month, a dangerous escalation between Russia and Ukraine happened.
However, the situation improved when on 12 February 2015 the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany have reached a ceasefire deal after 17 hours of talks in Minsk, Belarus, on the Ukrainian conflict.

Moreover, the second peak, in May 2017, is more marked in France: indeed, on 29 May 2017, French President Macron and Putin met in their fist face-to-face talk.

### Coronavirus
![Covid Distribution per country](/assets/img/Project_graphics/Corona_Distribution_percountry.png)  

The Quotebank dataset covered only the first months for this important thematic. Therefore, no big difference can be noticed between the countries.

However, one can see that in Italy the weight of the distribution in February 2020 was much higher than in the other countries.

The explanation is very simple: Italy was the first European country to be severely hit by Covid-19 and the first to impose strict rules to fight the contagion.

### Terrorism
![Terrorism Distribution per country](/assets/img/Project_graphics/Terrorism_Distribution_per_country.png)  

![Terrorism Top Speakers](/assets/img/Project_graphics/Terrorism_Top_Speakers.png)

The first tragic aspect to note in this topic is that the most quoted speakers are French.
This is clearly related to the particular gravity of the terrorism problem in France.

In addition, we can notice that Italy has no big peaks as it has never been targeted by attacks. The same could be said about Poland, but Donald Tusk, who is polish, happened to be the President of the European Council during these events.

On the other hand, Spain has a peak (August 2017) that it is not shared with the other countries. This is also the case for Germany, in December 2016.

Therefore, we will analyse the three biggest peaks, January 2015, November 2015 and July 2016, as well as the Spanish and German ones.

#### <center>January 2015</center>
<center><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Je_suis_Charlie%2C_Paris_11_January_2015_%283%29.jpg' width=600></center>

From 7 to 9 January 2015, terrorist attacks occurred across the Île-de-France region, particularly in Paris. Three attackers killed a total of 17 in four shooting attacks, and police then killed the three assailants.

The most renowned is the first one: on 7 January, two gunmen attacked the headquarters of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people and wounding 12 others before escaping.

#### November 2015

On 13 November 2015, a series of coordinated Islamist terrorist attacks took place in Paris:
- Three suicide bombers struck outside the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, during an international football match, after failing to gain entry to the stadium.
- Another group of attackers then fired on crowded cafés and restaurants in Paris, with one of them also blowing himself up.
- A third group carried out another mass shooting and took hostages at a rock concert attended by 1,500 people in the Bataclan theatre.

The attackers killed 130 people, including 90 at the Bataclan theatre.Another 416 people were injured, almost 100 critically.

#### July 2016

On the evening of 14 July 2016, a 19-tonne cargo truck was deliberately driven into crowds of people celebrating Bastille Day on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, France, resulting in the deaths of 86 people and the injury of 458 others.

#### <center>December 2016</center>
<center><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Terroranschlag-Berlin-Breitscheidplatz-2016_%282%29_%2831731061626%29_%28square_crop%29.jpg/1280px-Terroranschlag-Berlin-Breitscheidplatz-2016_%282%29_%2831731061626%29_%28square_crop%29.jpg' width=400></center>

On 19 December 2016, an unsuccessful asylum seeker from Tunisia drove a stolen truck through a Christmas market at Breitscheidplatz in the City West of Berlin, killing 11 people and injuring 56.

The incident is the deadliest terrorist attack in Germany since an attack at Oktoberfest in Munich in 1980.

#### August 2017<

On the afternoon of 17 August 2017, 22-year-old Younes Abouyaaqoub drove a van into pedestrians on La Rambla in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain killing 13 people and injuring at least 130 others, one of whom died 10 days later on 27 August. Abouyaaqoub fled the attack on foot, then killed another person in order to steal the victim's car to make his escape.

Nine hours after the Barcelona attack, five men thought to be members of the same terrorist cell drove into pedestrians in nearby Cambrils, killing one woman and injuring six others.

### Most popular topics per country
![Summary](/assets/img/Project_graphics/Summary_Distribution_percountry_pertopic.png)

All the previous explanations naturally suggest what we can see from this image:

- the most important topic in France is terrorism, as the country was the target of many attacks.
- in Italy, immigration is the most popular topic. This is because of the European migrant crisis and of the favourable geographical position of Italy.
- Germany, as well as Spain, do not have remarkably more popular topics. Indeed, for example, both countries faced the problems of immigration and were target of terrorists.<br>One difference could be that, in Spain, the Russia topic was much less important than in Germany, probably because of the key roles of German politicians in the relation between EU and Russia.
- in Poland, the European Union / Brexit and Russia topics were the most important ones. This could be explained by the key importance of the Polish politician Donald Tusk, Former President of the European Council, in these topics because of his role.

## Research question 2
Now we will examine how much the opinions of rigth hand parties differ compared to a party with similar political orientation from another country for our topics. We chose right hand parties because we are interested in showing distinctions between the parties, which seems easier with more extreme parties. 
Let us first take a look which parties we will consider:
